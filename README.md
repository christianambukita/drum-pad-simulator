# Retro Drum Pad

This project originaly started as a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine). 

After fulfilling fCC project requirements I decided to add some features to expand this app.

## UI design

Designing UI I took some inspiration from 90's anime retro futurism style. I tried to simulate the feeling of interacting with an retro digital device.
